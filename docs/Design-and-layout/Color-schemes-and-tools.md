# Color Schemes & Tools

## Scope

Color Schemes & Tools covers standard Catalyst convention regarding color schemes and provides a recommended toolset.

## Schemes

Users are free to implement any color scheme they like. For green field projects, we highly recommend using the [Material Design color system](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#), especially to get started.

## Tools

* [material.io color tool](https://material.io/tools/color) for ***basic color schemems***. Provides excellent color sets for basic schemes, and the ability to create custom sets within the same framework. Since Catalyst uses [Material Design](https://materia.io) for general style guidelines, this fits natrually into the stack and toolchain. 
* [paletton.com](http://paletton.com) for ***color sequences*** and ***advanced color schemes***. Basic tool provides a nice "spread" of colors around the base. Easy to adjust base color and the spread. Use the outer wheel to select the hue, and then move the points on the inner wheel to determine lightness and saturation, as well as the relataion of the spread to the base color. Can also be used to generate fine-tuned and highy custom color schemes using a number of contrast and complimentary functions. Can also provide a good set of live examples for web, artwork, etc. as well as simulate color-blindness.
